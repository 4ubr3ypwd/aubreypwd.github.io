            Morning Afternoon Evening   Morning  The works of the gods are full of providence, and the works of fortune are not separate from nature or the interweaving and intertwining of the things governed by providence. Everything flows from there. Further factors are necessity and the benefit of the whole universe, of which you are a part. What is brought by the nature of the whole and what maintains that nature is good for each part of nature.

            Morning Afternoon Evening   Morning  It isn’t the things themselves that disturb people, but the judgements that they form about them. Death, for instance, is nothing terrible, or else it would have seemed so to Socrates too; no, it is in the judgement that death is terrible that the terror lies. Accordingly, whenever we are impeded, disturbed or distressed, we should never blame anyone else but only ourselves, that is, our judgements.

            Morning Afternoon Evening   Morning  It is important to understand that nature creates in parents affection for their children; and parental affection is the source from which we trace the shared community of the human race … As it is obvious that it is natural to us to shrink from pain, so it is clear that we derive from nature itself the motive to love those to whom we have given birth.

            Morning Afternoon Evening   Morning  Morning Text for Reflection
The wise person does nothing that he could regret, nothing against his will, but does everything honourably, consistently, seriously, and rightly; he anticipates nothing as if it is bound to happen, but is shocked by nothing when it does happen …. and refers everything to his own judgement, and stands by his own decisions. I can conceive of nothing which is happier that this.

            So the last month or so I’ve been journaling a little bit different. A while go, I ran across a video that went over the idea of the Five Minute Journal, and I was intrigued.
The idea is you answer a few simple prompts:
I am grateful for: What would make today great? Daily affirmation. I am: 3 Amazing things that happened today: How could I have made today even better:  …and I did that for about a week before I felt it lacked a Stoic-seasoning, and so I worked and re-worked that format until I landed on a format that has both accomplish the goal of making journaling a little easier and getting your Stoic practice in.

Traditionally, the words for the four primary virtues of Stoicism are:
Wisdom Justice Courage Temperance  If you’re about to do a thing, you ask yourself:
Am I being Wise? Am I being Just? Am I being Courageous? Am I being Temperate?  But, none of these words have ever really meant much for me.
