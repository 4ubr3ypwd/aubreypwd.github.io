      <description>Today I did some experimenting. You see my system is entirely customized to be super-efficient and automated.

 Wisdom Justice Courage Temperance  If you’re about to do a thing, you ask yourself:
 Am I being Wise? Am I being Just? Am I being Courageous? Am I being Temperate?  But, none of these words have ever really meant much for me.</description>
