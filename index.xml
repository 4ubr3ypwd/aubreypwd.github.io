      <description>Today I had a lot of fun building a new site for aubreypwd.com using Hugo and Github Pages.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of time to work on a website, let alone write content for one. In fact, I used to have a pretty nice site, but I never kept up with it, and eventually just redirected it to Twitter. I also tried out write.as to try and publish content, but I found I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use it a lot.</description>

 Traditionally, the words for the four primary virtues of Stoicism are:
 Wisdom Justice Courage Temperance  If youâ€™re about to do a thing, you ask yourself:
 Am I beingÂ Wise? Am I beingÂ Just? Am I beingÂ Courageous? Am I beingÂ Temperate?  But, none of theseÂ wordsÂ have ever reallyÂ meantÂ much for me.</description>
