      <description>Today I had a lot of fun building a new site for aubreypwd.com using Hugo and Github Pages.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of time to work on a website, let alone write content for one. In fact, I used to have a pretty nice site, but I never kept up with it, and eventually just redirected it to Twitter. I also tried out write.as to try and publish content, but I found I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use it a lot.</description>
