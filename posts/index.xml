            <description>Today I had a lot of fun building a new site for aubreypwd.com using Hugo and Github Pages.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of time to work on a website, let alone write content for one. In fact, I used to have a pretty nice site, but I never kept up with it, and eventually just redirected it to Twitter. I also tried out write.as to try and publish content, but I found I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use it a lot.</description>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to work on a website, let alone write content for one. In fact, I used to have a pretty nice site, but I never kept up with it, and eventually just redirected it to Twitter. I also tried out <a href="https://write.as">write.as</a> to try and publish content, but I found I didn&rsquo;t really use it a lot.</p>
<p>The kind of site I&rsquo;ve always wanted is just a simple one: a bit about who I am with links to all the things you can use to find out more about me. Content is sort of a mehâ€”I&rsquo;d rather be coding :)â€”and I usually blog over <a href="https://webdevstudios.com/author/aubreypwd/">@WebDevStudios</a> anyways.</p>
<p>Really, this isn&rsquo;t even a blog, the only reason I enabled posts is so I could post updates every once in a while&hellip; and maybe content&hellip; but don&rsquo;t hold your breath, I mostly post on <a href="https://twitter.com/aubreypwd">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted a dead-simple site, I also want a site that is totally under version control (content and all). WordPress doesn&rsquo;t do that, Hugo does. Plus, it was fun to learn and use something new, and was much easier than (<em>but similar enought to</em>) <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to setup. I would hightly recommend it!</p>
<p>This site is going to be much easier to maintain and deploy than a WordPress one. Also, I could write in Markdown natively, which felt warm-and-fuzzy.</p>
