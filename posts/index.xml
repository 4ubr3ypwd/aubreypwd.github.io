            <description>Morning Afternoon Evening   Morning In accordance to my Social Duty, I am sharing my thoughts from my morning exercise. I was highly motivated by Chuck Chakrapani&amp;rsquo;s presentation at Stoicon this year (as you will see). I set out this morning re-defining the virtues for myself, to set my focus for the day and week ahead:
Wisdom: as the lack of foolishness  A stoic is not a fool, for fools often stumble, fall, and grow frustrated and unhappy It would be foolish to fear the unknown, at the risk of doubling your fear It would be foolish to try and control something you absolutely have no control over All other virtues aim and not being the fool, thus calling for wisdom in them all  Courage: as a lack of fear  Replace fear with caution, aware of it, doing only what you can, yet utterly let go of controlling it Fearlessness, then, is at the hexrart of Courage Since you are not in control of everything, you are called to endure those things  Justice: as a lack of social duty  &amp;ldquo;What is not good for the beehive, is not good for the bee,&amp;rdquo; Marcus A.</description>

<p>In accordance to my Social Duty, I am sharing my thoughts from my morning exercise. I was highly motivated by Chuck Chakrapani&rsquo;s presentation at Stoicon this year (as you will see). I set out this morning re-defining the virtues for myself, to set my focus for the day and week ahead:</p>
<h3 id="wisdom-as-the-lack-of-foolishness">Wisdom: as the lack of foolishness</h3>
<ul>
<li>A stoic is not a fool, for fools often stumble, fall, and grow frustrated and unhappy</li>
<li>It would be foolish to fear the unknown, at the risk of doubling your fear</li>
<li>It would be foolish to try and control something you absolutely have no control over</li>
<li>All other virtues aim and not being the fool, thus calling for wisdom in them all</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="courage-as-a-lack-of-fear">Courage: as a lack of fear</h3>
<ul>
<li>Replace fear with caution, aware of it, doing only what you can, yet utterly let go of controlling it</li>
<li>Fearlessness, then, is at the hexrart of Courage</li>
<li>Since you are not in control of everything, you are called to endure those things</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="justice-as-a-lack-of-social-duty">Justice: as a lack of social duty</h3>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What is not good for the beehive, is not good for the bee,&rdquo; Marcus A.</li>
<li>Because we are social beings, it would be foolish to think that an un-healthy society will be of any benefit to you</li>
<li>Start with your home-life, as it is the first city in which you live</li>
<li>Make sure and vote!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="moderation-as-a-lack-of-excess">Moderation: as a lack of excess</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderation is minimalistic at heart, and you will be overtaken by excess if you let it, causing you to stumble and grow frustrated</li>
<li>Control your imagination, which can inflate your desire for that which is not present, and even in excess</li>
</ul>
<p>I really liked how Chuck put it, and throughout Stoic week I am going to focus on taking a &ldquo;chisel away&rdquo; approach to the virtues as opposed to simply the call to do them. In order to do them, you have to &ldquo;chisel&rdquo; away the thing to not do&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="afternoon">Afternoon</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a few minutes this lunch-time to think of a few ways in which you could make progress towards caring better for yourself, others, or your world.</p>
<p>Note down some first steps, things that you could do during this week or the next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have always believed, in order to take care of other people, you have to have sound-mind yourself. And so I am always working on remaining calm and letting go of control. I will, of course, continue to do that&hellip;</p>
<p>For others, I will, of course, always begin with my family. Making sure they are happy and that <em>peace</em> is kept within the household, that way we can all be our best selves in the world.</p>
<p>For the world, I will continue to do small thing like recycle, pick up trash when I see it along my way, and appriciate nature deeply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of one or two larger moves in this direction – broader aims in life that you may have lost sight of in the daily demands on your time and attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One larger move I could do is, for one, VOTE! I neglected participating in politics in my younger years, but this year, and this climate, has shown me it&rsquo;s important to be active by being countetd. A broader move I could make is maybe getting more involved locally, e.g. at my children&rsquo;s school and participating in local government more. All things that are hard to do with two kids, COVID, two working parents, etc. But, are non-the-less still important.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="evening">Evening</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Evening Text for Reflection</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius thinks about the qualities of his friend, Sextus, which helped Marcus to make progress in learning how to care for himself and others.</p>
<p>From Sextus [I learnt] kindliness … the idea of living according to nature; seriousness without affectation; perceptiveness in gauging his friends’ needs … the ability to fit in with everyone, so that his company was more pleasant than any kind of flattery, while at the same time he aroused the greatest respect from those who were with him; a secure and methodical discovery and organization of the principles necessary for life; never to give the impression of anger or any other passion but to be at once completely free of passion and yet full of affection for other people; to speak well of others without making a fuss about it, and deep learning without ostentation. - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>One of my favorite parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">the Meditations</a> is in the very first book where he honors his family, friends, and teachers for the qualities they shown him over the years. Many of the greater Stoic qualities are expounded in book one alone. I used to scrub over this part of the book early on, but the more I re-read <em>the Meditations</em> the more the qualities of those <em>other than Marcus himeself</em> stand out to me.</p>
<p>In my life, I often long for mentors. But, thankfully I have great teachers, e.g. the very <em>&ldquo;great four&rdquo;</em> (Marcus, Epicitus, Seneca, and Musonious) for being my teachers. And, for modern-day Stoic heros like <a href="https://twitter.com/mpigliucci">Massimo Pigliucci</a>, <a href="https://ryanholiday.net">Ryan Holiday</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/37ukzii">Chris Fisher</a>, among many many more that are too numerous to count here for exemplifying qualities I very much admire.</p>
<p>I am also reminded of the <em>new Polis</em> in which we live in, <em>The Internet</em>. And, how much it has flourished as much as a great city or nation that I am forever greatful for and indebted to. I&rsquo;m reminded how much I need to give back to this <em>&ldquo;new city.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Lastly I&rsquo;m reminded to look at the people I maybe wouldn&rsquo;t praise, but otherwise learned a great deal from. The one&rsquo;s who maybe didn&rsquo;t teach me great and profound things, but taught me the small, but necessary, things about life; even if it was not what to do. To them I am also equally as greatful, and look to honor as well in my thoughts tonight.</p>

            <title>Apple Watch SE Review</title>
            <link>https://aubreypwd.com/apple-watch-se-watch-os-7-review/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://aubreypwd.com/apple-watch-se-watch-os-7-review/</guid>
            <description>About 2 weeks ago I bought an Apple Watch SE. This is my review/experience so far.
Note that I do not sync things to my watch, as I prefer to play most things directly from my iPhone, just a quick note for the below, as I&amp;rsquo;m not doing any syncing for Music, Audiobooks, and Podcasts.
The Bad Audiobooks &amp;amp; Podcasts Show Wrong Episode As you can see I&amp;rsquo;m listening to The Daily Stoic, but it&amp;rsquo;s showing Stoicism on Fire!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 2 weeks ago I bought an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>. This is my review/experience so far.</p>
<p><em>Note that I do not sync things to my watch, as I prefer to play most things directly from my iPhone, just a quick note for the below, as I&rsquo;m not doing any syncing for Music, Audiobooks, and Podcasts.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<h3 id="audiobooks--podcasts-show-wrong-episode">Audiobooks &amp; Podcasts Show Wrong Episode</h3>
<p><img src="/images/2308529140/IMG_0905.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/2308529140/IMG_0906.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see I&rsquo;m listening to <a href="https://dailystoic.com/podcast/">The Daily Stoic</a>, but it&rsquo;s showing <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stoicism-on-fire/id1368482721">Stoicism on Fire</a>!</p>
<p>When I play/pause it plays/pauses whatever is playing on my iPhone, but it shows the wrong thing. Also when you start up e.g. Podcasts on my watch, it starts to autoplay the wrong episode, making where I <em>really</em> was on my iPhone now off-track; e.g. with the above episodes, if I open my watch via the Apps area it will play Stoicism on Fire, even though I was playing an episode on The Daily Stoic.</p>
<p><em>This same experience on Audiobooks!</em></p>
<h3 id="i-cant-select-genres-in-music">I can&rsquo;t select Genres in Music</h3>
<p>So one of my favorite genres of music (when I&rsquo;m in my car) is Country (from my library), and on my phone I can just select the Country genre and shuffle, but I can&rsquo;t do this on my watch.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2308529140/IMG_0909.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It shows Playlists, Artists, Albums and Songs, no Genre. Not a deal-breaker but I usually listen to my music using Genres when I&rsquo;m on my iPhone or Mac.</p>
<h4 id="update-music-genre">Update!</h4>
<p>I was able to figure out a <em>way</em> to do this using a Smart Playlist that populates with Country music genre:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/images/1343508415/IMG_0913.PNG" alt="" style="margin:auto" />
</p>
<h3 id="i-cant-tell-it-to-play-one-track-in-audiobooks">I can&rsquo;t tell it to play one track in Audiobooks</h3>
<p>I listen to a <em>lot</em> of audiobooks, and one of my favorite features on the phone is the one where you can tell it to stop after the current track finishes. I can&rsquo;t get this feature when listening to an audiobook on the watch. It will continue to the next track no matter what.</p>
<h3 id="the-crown-sticks">The Crown Sticks</h3>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really got a lot of benefit out of the workouts yet, but when I play Tennis 🎾 the sweat, the next morning, usually makes the crown stick. I usually have to wash it under water (spinning it under hot water) to get it to work, but having to wash it makes me super nervous too. I know it&rsquo;s water resistant, but still&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="the-face--complications">The Face &amp; Complications</h3>
<p>I currently have 8 complication setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your schedule</li>
<li>Reminders</li>
<li>Voice Memos</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>The date</li>
<li>Battery</li>
<li>Weather</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, I just tried to take a screenshot of my face using the double button thing&hellip;.it restarted my watch 😒, so here&rsquo;s a photo of my hairy arms:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2308529140/IMG_0912.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Having my next meeting on my watch has reduced the need for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/next-meeting/id1017470484?mt=12">Next Meeting</a> on my Mac. Also seeing how many todo&rsquo;s I have today is great! The weather is nice to because I have a rule: if it&rsquo;s below 70, I wear pants lol. So, making this decision everyday is even quicker! Also being able to start voice memos and control my music (usually in my car) is super nice (for the most part).</p>
<h3 id="reminders">Reminders</h3>
<p>I just went shopping, and being able to go through my shopping list on my watch/wrist vs. having to pull out my iPhone (an iPhone 8 Plus) is almost the #1 reason I will keep my watch no matter what! But also being able to look through my todos is super nice!</p>
<h3 id="voice-memos">Voice Memos</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty forgetful person, or when I have a good idea it&rsquo;s nice to be able to make an audio note in seconds vs., again, having to pull my iPhone out. Plus, it just works!</p>
<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>
<p>Aside from the cool complication I noted above, being able to see my schedule at a glance is super nice. I use it mostly for a quick glance in the morning to see if I have any last-minute morning meetings I need to get to, or when someone asks me if I have time to do something, I don&rsquo;t have to pull out my iPhone to give a quick answer.</p>
<h3 id="the-design">The Design</h3>
<p>I love wearing this thing. I wear it all the time, except when I sleep (when I charge it). It&rsquo;s just the perfect thing to have on my writst, and the default band that came with it is perfect!</p>
<h3 id="the-battery">The Battery</h3>
<p>The battery has been super good. I usually have 30/40% left by the time I go to bed. No problems there (probably don&rsquo;t need the complication).</p>
<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>
<p>Being able to quickly see a notification (that would otherwise buzz in my pocket) at a glance has been super convinient (especially when driving). Also being able to respond to e.g. a text message quickly is also very helpful and convinient.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When the watch is bad, it&rsquo;s bad. One of the big things that got me to buy this thing was the convienence of controling things when I drive (I like to drive a lot) and so when it doesn&rsquo;t work I&rsquo;m usually screwing with my watch and iPhone in my car at the same time and it&rsquo;s stressful (not to mention dangerous). I want this thing to just work! I feel, if they did, the watch would be perfect!</p>
<p>But, at the same time it&rsquo;s been super useful and helpful&hellip;so I&rsquo;m very much on the wall about the watch. I probably will keep it, but it will end up being really annoying if I have to whip out my iPhone to listen to a Podcast or Audiobook because the problems above don&rsquo;t resolve eventually.</p>
<p>I really hope the issues with the things above iron out, because I would really love to love this device more!</p>

            <title>My Stoic Five-minute Journal</title>
            <link>https://aubreypwd.com/stoic-five-minute-journal/</link>

            <guid>https://aubreypwd.com/stoic-five-minute-journal/</guid>
            <description>So the last month or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been journaling a little bit different. A while go, I ran across a video that went over the idea of the Five Minute Journal, and I was intrigued.
The idea is you answer a few simple prompts:
 I am grateful for: What would make today great? Daily affirmation. I am: 3 Amazing things that happened today: How could I have made today even better:  &amp;hellip;and I did that for about a week before I felt it lacked a Stoic-seasoning, and so I worked and re-worked that format until I landed on a format that has both accomplish the goal of making journaling a little easier and getting your Stoic practice in.</description>

<p>So the last month or so I&rsquo;ve been journaling a little bit different. A while go, I ran across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA">video</a> that went over the idea of the <em>Five Minute Journal</em>, and I was intrigued.</p>
<p>The idea is you answer a few simple prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am grateful for:</li>
<li>What would make today great?</li>
<li>Daily affirmation. I am:</li>
<li>3 Amazing things that happened today:</li>
<li>How could I have made today even better:</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and I did that for about a week before I felt it lacked a Stoic-seasoning, and so I worked and re-worked that format until I landed on a format that has both accomplish the goal of making journaling a little easier <em>and</em> getting your Stoic practice in.</p>
<p>I would recommend giving <a href="https://dailystoic.com/prepare-morning-review-evening/">this</a> a read before you look into the morning and evening prompts below.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="morning-prompts">Morning Prompts</h2>
<h4 id="i-am-looking-forward-to">I am looking forward to:</h4>
<p>This prompt is like &ldquo;I am grateful for&rdquo; but it aims to make sure you look forward to something during the day. All to often we wake up and head right into doing things in a todo list, but identifying those things which you are looking forward to doing (note, that doesn&rsquo;t have to be something in your todo list) makes the outlook for the day that much better.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hanging out with my kids tonight</li>
<li>Being productive (insert specific important task today)</li>
<li>Reading time</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-can-i-make-today-great">How can I make today great?</h3>
<p>Much like &ldquo;What would make today great&rdquo; prompt from the classic form, I found this to be really powerful when I was working with the five-minute journal idea. The focus, though, is on how <em>you</em> can make today great and what <em>you are in control of</em>, which are <em>your</em> actions!</p>
<h4 id="example-1">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Sticking to my diet so I feel better about myself today</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Not letting other people&rsquo;s opinions and actions bother me</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, these get written as tasks, because later on I will check off the one&rsquo;s I honored throughout the day as a part of my evening review.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-i-do-towards-my-weekly-goal">What can I do towards my weekly goal?</h3>
<p>Every week I choose a verse/concept from Stoicism to focus on, for instance this week was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reverence &amp; Service to Others</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>FYI, this is a positive quality Marcus associated with his mother.</em></p>
<p>But, then I choose a few <em>actionable</em> things I can do to put this into practice today, and I stick to the theme all week with new things to put it into practice everyday.</p>
<h4 id="example-2">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Serve someone who doesn&rsquo;t deserve it</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Show respect to your children</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-i-do-to-improve-today">What can I do to improve today?</h3>
<p>Here I choose a couple other qualities I want to improve on (often these repeat throughout the week) that I struggle with.</p>
<h4 id="example-3">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Stick to my diet</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Don&rsquo;t be harsh with my kids when they get out of hand</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-will-go-wrong">What will go wrong?</h3>
<p>This is where I take all the above aspirations and I think about what could go wrong, and what I would do.</p>
<h4 id="example-4">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>I may be tempted to eat the donuts someone brought home this morning
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Meditation on how good you will feel if you unhinge yourself from this temptation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Drink a glass of water w/ salt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kids may get out of hand and get crazy
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> See this as a part of nature, kids will be kids</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I get really deep on this and go through every aspect of my day that I can, jotting down what might trouble me or not meet my expectations and develop a plan for as much as I can.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="evening-prompts">Evening Prompts</h2>
<p>The first thing I do in the evening is review my morning prompts, marking off items I stuck to and items I did not sick to as a primer for the content I will write below.</p>
<h3 id="a-humbling-moment">A humbling moment</h3>
<p>This plays into the practice of <a href="https://dailystoic.com/premortem/">negative visualization</a>, and I either take a moment from the day (for instance I saw a homeless man today having trouble dragging his cart which had a broken wheel across the street) or I imagine one and reflect on it, putting myself in their shoes and noting how I would be a good stoic in that situation. Though this practice is a preparation, I find it serves (more practically) as a gratefulness practice.</p>
<h3 id="great-things-that-happened-today">Great things that happened today:</h3>
<p>This comes right out of the five minute journal. Remembering and taking note for the great things in your life cultivates contentedness.</p>
<h4 id="example-5">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>That my children are healthy and beautiful</li>
<li>That the weather was nice at the park today</li>
<li>That I have time to read about Stoicism</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-went-wrong-and-what-could-i-have-done-better">What went wrong (and what could I have done better)?</h3>
<p>Yes this is really two questions, but here I jot down, what went wrong. That&rsquo;s either via external circumstances or actions I did not do well. I also note what I could do better. I take lots of care here to note what I am and not in control of.</p>
<h4 id="example-6">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>I got harsh with Lexie when she was screaming while playing</li>
</ul>
<p>Kids will be kids (you are not in control of what they decided to do ultimately), and they have a lot of learning to do. My bodily response to this (frustration) does not control that I could have chosen to speak softly and kindly about what they should do, and shouldn&rsquo;t, and why.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-died-today-will-you-have-died-well">If you died today, will you have died well?</h3>
<p>This is something I have always written on at the end of my day, and so it <em>had</em> to be adopted into this format. I think the best gift a person can give to themselves is a good death, but that can only be done by being happy with yourself.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! I have had a wonderful time with this format vs. some of the others I have done in the past and I have felt it has helped be both prepare for my day, and end my day well. If you try it out, let me know how it goes!</p>

            <description>Note, I&amp;rsquo;ve entirely ditched this system and opted for a new one I will post about later.
 Today I did some experimenting. You see my system is entirely customized to be super-efficient and automated.

As you can see I currently have these housed in a giant Git repository in my ~/.config/. This has worked out just fine for a while, but I wanted to experiment with trying to de-centralize it with some kind of package management.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Note, I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://twitter.com/aubreypwd/status/1307807612646219776?s=20">entirely ditched</a> this system and opted for a new one I will post about later.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Today I did some experimenting. You see my system is entirely customized to be super-efficient and automated.</p>
<p><a href="/images/greenshot-2020-09-18-184905.png"><img src="/images/greenshot-2020-09-18-184905.png" alt="Screenshot of my current .config"></a></p>
<p>As you can see I currently have these housed in a giant Git repository in my <code>~/.config/</code>. This has worked out just fine for a while, but I wanted to experiment with trying to de-centralize it with some kind of package management.</p>
<p>Today I focused on my <code>.gitconfig</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> files as an experiment with just my &ldquo;dot-files&rdquo;, and this is what I&rsquo;ve come up with:</p>
<p>So I wantedo to figure out what package manager is going to best serve me here. After looking at a lot of them, e.g. npm, bpkg, composer, and a slew of others, I settled on spamming Composer. I know my &ldquo;packages&rdquo; are not PHP, but Composer doesn&rsquo;t care about that, plus of all the package managers it&rsquo;s the easiest to install with git repo support (try doing that with npm or other package managers out there), it manages them well in a reliable location, and on top of that with <code>composer-installers</code> I think I can do some really cool magic later on&hellip;</p>
<p>So I settled on Composer, hate me.</p>
<p>So first I got my <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>.gitconfig</code> files into their own packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aubreypwd/.gitconfig">https://github.com/aubreypwd/.gitconfig</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aubreypwd/.gitignore">https://github.com/aubreypwd/.gitignore</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;that I could now easliy install to a reliable place, <code>~/.composer</code>. Both packages automatically symlink my <code>~/.gitconfig|ignore</code> file for me using the <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/sioweb/ccevent"><code>/sioweb/ccevent</code></a> package. Even if you supply, e.g. a <code>post-package-install</code> script for the package, because you install it as a dependancy those scripts to not fire. But this package, when installed along side it, will look for <code>package-scripts</code> and run those, so I was able to add that to both packages and when you install them that automatically runs and runs a <code>symlink.sh</code> script.</p>
<p>This symlinking solution on install is great because once I install one of these packages, it symlinks my dot-file in <code>$HOME</code> for me, vs me having to do it manually.</p>
<p>So now I can install dot-files individually and I can automate symlinking them!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious how the rest of this experiment is going to go&hellip;</p>

            <description>Today I had a lot of fun building a new site for aubreypwd.com using Hugo and Github Pages.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of time to work on a website, let alone write content for one. In fact, I used to have a pretty nice site, but I never kept up with it, and eventually just redirected it to Twitter. I also tried out write.as to try and publish content, but I found I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use it a lot.</description>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to work on a website, let alone write content for one. In fact, I used to have a pretty nice site, but I never kept up with it, and eventually just redirected it to Twitter. I also tried out <a href="https://write.as">write.as</a> to try and publish content, but I found I didn&rsquo;t really use it a lot.</p>
<p>The kind of site I&rsquo;ve always wanted is just a simple one: a bit about who I am with links to all the things you can use to find out more about me. Content is sort of a meh—I&rsquo;d rather be coding :)—and I usually blog over <a href="https://webdevstudios.com/author/aubreypwd/">@WebDevStudios</a> anyways.</p>
<p>Really, this isn&rsquo;t even a blog, the only reason I enabled posts is so I could post updates every once in a while&hellip; and maybe content&hellip; but don&rsquo;t hold your breath, I mostly post on <a href="https://twitter.com/aubreypwd">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted a dead-simple site, I also want a site that is totally under version control (content and all). WordPress doesn&rsquo;t do that, Hugo does. Plus, it was fun to learn and use something new, and was much easier than (<em>but similar enought to</em>) <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to setup. I would hightly recommend it!</p>
<p>This site is going to be much easier to maintain and deploy than a WordPress one. Also, I could write in Markdown natively, which felt warm-and-fuzzy.</p>

 Traditionally, the words for the four primary virtues of Stoicism are:
 Wisdom Justice Courage Temperance  If you’re about to do a thing, you ask yourself:
 Am I being Wise? Am I being Just? Am I being Courageous? Am I being Temperate?  But, none of these words have ever really meant much for me.</description>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditionally, the words for the four primary virtues of Stoicism are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Wisdom</strong></li>
<li><strong>Justice</strong></li>
<li><strong>Courage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Temperance</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re about to do a thing, you ask yourself:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Am I being <strong>Wise</strong>?</li>
<li>Am I being <strong>Just</strong>?</li>
<li>Am I being <strong>Courageous</strong>?</li>
<li>Am I being <strong>Temperate</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, none of these <em>words</em> have ever really <em>meant</em> much for me<em>. </em>They don’t reach out to me and explain themselves very well. They’re very academic sounding, lofty, and words that don’t guide me towards my next action. Sometimes they leave me asking, <em>what do I even do?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I’ve come up with my own <em>words</em> for these virtues:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h2 id="0f11">Wisdom → Truth</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What does Wisdom <em>really</em> mean? — <em>I think</em> it means looking at the world clearly and truthfully. It’s all about the correct knowledge of what’s in front of you:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>What is <em>really</em> happening right now?</li>
<li>Am I truly in danger of being fired? Is this just my mind racing away from me?</li>
<li>What is this person’s story, why are they <em>really </em>acting this way?</li>
<li>Why is this bothering me? Is it really that bothersome? Is <em>it</em> actually bothering me, or is it just my attitude towards this thing?</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Too often we look at a given situation and judge it almost <em>immediately</em> for face value. Marcus (and Epictetus) tell us to not to <em>trust first appearances</em>, especially within our own mind. I think this is at the heart of <em>Wisdom.</em> It’s the ability to dissect and analyze any given perception or thing for its truth, absent (mostly) of our own judgements and opinions — <em>seeing things for what they truly are</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marcus asks us, all the time in the <em>Meditations</em>, to wipe our opinions clean and change them <em>right on the spot</em>! But, it would be wrong to think that Marcus is asking us to just have some change of heart out of no-where. To change our opinions, we need <em>knowledge</em> and that knowledge needs to be based on <em>truth</em> and examination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Why am I so upset about the dog digging a hole in the yard, is it really that hard to fix? Is the dog <em>trying</em> to hurt my feelings? I’m acting as if he is!</li>
<li>Is the universe really out to get me? I <em>just</em> got a flat tire because of a nail, and it looks like it fell off a truck on the highway, the guy must have been in a rush for some reason — maybe to get to his next job he dearly needs.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the <em>pause</em> you take to look at something for what it <em>really</em> is, not what you <em>think it is. </em>Or, the gall to admit you don’t know enough. With experience this becomes easier, <em>obviously</em>, but nothing stops us from pausing and acting when we feel we have the truth of the matter<em>, </em>or admitting that we don’t have all the information to act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h2 id="d236">Justice → Service</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Justice, if you’re like me, comes off very <em>noble (rightfully so) </em>and <em>legislative,</em> and more concerned about <em>weighing</em> what is right and wrong instead of what actually <em>is</em> right and wrong. In the books of the Stoics, Justice comes off more personal and neighborly to me. I use a version of the <em>Golden Rule</em> as a reminder:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Serve others the way you would serve yourself</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a <em>reflective</em> virtue.<em> It comes with a built-in manual</em>: if you want something <em>for</em> <em>yourself</em>, ensure <em>others</em> get it as well!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>You want “me-time?” Give others “me-time”!</li>
<li>If you want to be understood, try and understand others.</li>
<li>If you hate doing the dishes, don’t expect others to enjoy doing the dishes.</li>
<li>If you want to be wealthy, help others be wealthy!</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The word s<em>erve</em> is important, because it’s not enough to just to “<em>treat</em> others the way you would want to be treated” (which implies that you only do this when you come into contact with them), but <em>serving</em> someone with justice is a <em>duty</em> and asks of you to <em>go out</em> and help others gain the very things <em>you</em> want out of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h2 id="05a3">Courage → Fearlessness</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently I did an entire reading of the entire <em>Meditations</em>, and noted each time a particular theme came up. <em>Fearlessness</em> came up often, <em>like a lot</em>! It came up in a lot of different ways:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Not caring what other people think of you</li>
<li>Not caring if people blame you for things</li>
<li>Tackling challenging tasks (not fearing them)</li>
<li>Not fearing the future</li>
<li>Not even caring whether you are going to die!</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point I think Epictetus asks us, basically, to “<em>fear nothing,</em>” since all un-folding of life is <em>intended</em> and <em>natural</em>!<em> S</em>ince life is going to unfold how it unfolds (either by God or just being the way it is), it’s <em>best</em> to not go out whining and complaining, but <em>fearlessly!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have a mental exercise that helps me ascertain how to <em>fearlessly</em> approach a situation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="8918">Temperance → Detachment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Temperance, when you first hear it — it comes off as being cool-headed and patient. These are all good virtues, but <em>how</em> you do that is very hard to discern. In all my studying, I’ve found that the only way to be <em>temperate</em> is to <em>detach from things</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s an example (from Epictetus) that I love to exemplify this virtue (paraphrased):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Life is a banquet. When a platter of delicious food is handed to you, sample it. If you’re waiting for the platter to come to you, do not seek it out, wait for it to come to you. If it never comes, pay no matter to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I feel like the central theme here is <em>detachment</em>. “<em>Sample it</em>” he says, which seems to imply actually <em>enjoying things</em> (which is awesome right), but done so in moderated way (e.g. <em>sample</em>). Further reading will show that it’s <em>really</em> the concern of <em>attachment</em> to pleasant things that is being disciplined. The gist of <em>most of the Stoics</em> is that if you continually enjoy nice things, you will develop habits and familiarity with them, which could <em>attach</em> you to said external thing — say if it goes away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, he goes on to instruct that if the platter floats about the room, to not <em>want</em> after it or seek it out. And, even more so, if it never makes its way over to you, or you were accidentally <em>skipped</em>, to pay no matter to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Detach from things: expectations, outcomes, wealth, behaviors, etc. It doesn’t mean don’t expect anything, or not enjoy a wealth. But <em>sample</em> them, moderately and appropriately, and pay no matter if they don’t even come to you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t be attached to <em>it, </em>whatever <em>it</em> is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p style="text-align: center;">Find truth, serve others, be fearless, and detach!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
