            So today for #5ftf @WebDevStudios I thought I was going to work on fixing a few things on my fork of rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng and work some of them upstream, but I actually decided to use the panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend theme both of them are based on.
So here it is! üôåüèª ‚Äî It‚Äôs basically the same thing but a little easier to configure and work on.
Brief Life Update I also thought this would be a good chance to post something quickly about how things are going lately.

            So, the last few weeks I‚Äôve had a thing happen since switching to a MacBook Air recently. Since the CPU is not up to snuff as my old MacBook Pro (more to come on this switch later ‚å®Ô∏è), Sublime Text would hang for about a second on save of a file in a large project.
This likely went un-notice on my 2.7Ghz MacBook Pro, but started to notice it on my Air.

            Morning Afternoon Evening   Morning  The works of the gods are full of providence, and the works of fortune are not separate from nature or the interweaving and intertwining of the things governed by providence. Everything flows from there. Further factors are necessity and the benefit of the whole universe, of which you are a part. What is brought by the nature of the whole and what maintains that nature is good for each part of nature.

Death, for instance, is nothing terrible, or else it would have seemed so to Socrates too; no, it is in the judgement that death is terrible that the terror lies. Accordingly, whenever we are impeded, disturbed or distressed, we should never blame anyone else but only ourselves, that is, our judgements.

The wise person does nothing that he could regret, nothing against his will, but does everything honourably, consistently, seriously, and rightly; he anticipates nothing as if it is bound to happen, but is shocked by nothing when it does happen ‚Ä¶. and refers everything to his own judgement, and stands by his own decisions. I can conceive of nothing which is happier that this.

Note that I do not sync things to my watch, as I prefer to play most things directly from my iPhone, just a quick note for the below, as I‚Äôm not doing any syncing for Music, Audiobooks, and Podcasts.
The Bad Audiobooks &amp; Podcasts Show Wrong Episode As you can see I‚Äôm listening to The Daily Stoic, but it‚Äôs showing Stoicism on Fire!

            So the last month or so I‚Äôve been journaling a little bit different. A while go, I ran across a video that went over the idea of the Five Minute Journal, and I was intrigued.
The idea is you answer a few simple prompts:
I am grateful for: What would make today great? Daily affirmation. I am: 3 Amazing things that happened today: How could I have made today even better:  ‚Ä¶and I did that for about a week before I felt it lacked a Stoic-seasoning, and so I worked and re-worked that format until I landed on a format that has both accomplish the goal of making journaling a little easier and getting your Stoic practice in.

<p>As you can see I currently have these housed in a giant Git repository in my ~/.config/. This has worked out just fine for a while, but I wanted to experiment with trying to de-centralize it with some kind of package management.</p>

            Today I had a lot of fun building a new site for aubreypwd.com using Hugo and Github Pages.
I haven‚Äôt had a lot of time to work on a website, let alone write content for one. In fact, I used to have a pretty nice site, but I never kept up with it, and eventually just redirected it to Twitter. I also tried out write.as to try and publish content, but I found I didn‚Äôt really use it a lot.

Wisdom Justice Courage Temperance  If you‚Äôre about to do a thing, you ask yourself:
