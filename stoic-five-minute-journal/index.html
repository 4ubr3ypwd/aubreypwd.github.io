      <div class="post-content">
        <p><img src="/images/IMG_0840.jpg" alt="A photo of my journal on my desk."></p>
<p>So the last month or so I&rsquo;ve been journaling a little bit different. A while go, I ran across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA">video</a> that went over the idea of the <em>Five Minute Journal</em>, and I was intrigued.</p>
<p>The idea is you answer a few simple prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am grateful for:</li>
<li>What would make today great?</li>
<li>Daily affirmation. I am:</li>
<li>3 Amazing things that happened today:</li>
<li>How could I have made today even better:</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and I did that for about a week before I felt it lacked a Stoic-seasoning, and so I worked and re-worked that format until I landed on a format that has both accomplish the goal of making journaling a little easier <em>and</em> getting your Stoic practice in.</p>
<p>I would recommend giving <a href="https://dailystoic.com/prepare-morning-review-evening/">this</a> a read before you look into the morning and evening prompts below.</p>
<h2 id="morning-prompts">Morning Prompts</h2>
<h4 id="i-am-looking-forward-to">I am looking forward to:</h4>
<p>This prompt is like &ldquo;I am grateful for&rdquo; but it aims to make sure you look forward to something during the day. All to often we wake up and head right into doing things in a todo list, but identifying those things which you are looking forward to doing (note, that doesn&rsquo;t have to be something in your todo list) makes the outlook for the day that much better.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hanging out with my kids tonight</li>
<li>Being productive (insert specific important task today)</li>
<li>Reading time</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-can-i-make-today-great">How can I make today great?</h3>
<p>Much like &ldquo;What would make today great&rdquo; prompt from the classic form, I found this to be really powerful when I was working with the five-minute journal idea. The focus, though, is on how <em>you</em> can make today great and what <em>you are in control of</em>, which are <em>your</em> actions!</p>
<h4 id="example-1">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Sticking to my diet so I feel better about myself today</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Not letting other people&rsquo;s opinions and actions bother me</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, these get written as tasks, because later on I will check off the one&rsquo;s I honored throughout the day as a part of my evening review.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-i-do-towards-my-weekly-goal">What can I do towards my weekly goal?</h3>
<p>Every week I choose a verse/concept from Stoicism to focus on, for instance this week was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reverence &amp; Service to Others</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>FYI, this is a positive quality Marcus associated with his mother.</em></p>
<p>But, then I choose a few <em>actionable</em> things I can do to put this into practice today, and I stick to the theme all week with new things to put it into practice everyday.</p>
<h4 id="example-2">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Serve someone who doesn&rsquo;t deserve it</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Show respect to your children</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-i-do-to-improve-today">What can I do to improve today?</h3>
<p>Here I choose a couple other qualities I want to improve on (often these repeat throughout the week) that I struggle with.</p>
<h4 id="example-3">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Stick to my diet</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Don&rsquo;t be harsh with my kids when they get out of hand</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-will-go-wrong">What will go wrong?</h3>
<p>This is where I take all the above aspirations and I think about what could go wrong, and what I would do.</p>
<h4 id="example-4">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>I may be tempted to eat the donuts someone brought home this morning
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Meditation on how good you will feel if you unhinge yourself from this temptation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Drink a glass of water w/ salt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kids may get out of hand and get crazy
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> See this as a part of nature, kids will be kids</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I get really deep on this and go through every aspect of my day that I can, jotting down what might trouble me or not meet my expectations and develop a plan for as much as I can.</p>
<h2 id="evening-prompts">Evening Prompts</h2>
<p>The first thing I do in the evening is review my morning prompts, marking off items I stuck to and items I did not sick to as a primer for the content I will write below.</p>
<h3 id="a-humbling-moment">A humbling moment</h3>
<p>This plays into the practice of <a href="https://dailystoic.com/premortem/">negative visualization</a>, and I either take a moment from the day (for instance I saw a homeless man today having trouble dragging his cart which had a broken wheel across the street) or I imagine one and reflect on it, putting myself in their shoes and noting how I would be a good stoic in that situation. Though this practice is a preparation, I find it serves (more practically) as a gratefulness practice.</p>
<h3 id="great-things-that-happened-today">Great things that happened today:</h3>
<p>This comes right out of the five minute journal. Remembering and taking note for the great things in your life cultivates contentedness.</p>
<h4 id="example-5">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>That my children are healthy and beautiful</li>
<li>That the weather was nice at the park today</li>
<li>That I have time to read about Stoicism</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-went-wrong-and-what-could-i-have-done-better">What went wrong (and what could I have done better)?</h3>
<p>Yes this is really two questions, but here I jot down, what went wrong. That&rsquo;s either via external circumstances or actions I did not do well. I also note what I could do better. I take lots of care here to note what I am and not in control of.</p>
<h4 id="example-6">Example</h4>
<ul>
<li>I got harsh with Lexie when she was screaming while playing</li>
</ul>
<p>Kids will be kids (you are not in control of what they decided to do ultimately), and they have a lot of learning to do. My bodily response to this (frustration) does not control that I could have chosen to speak softly and kindly about what they should do, and shouldn&rsquo;t, and why.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-died-today-will-you-have-died-well">If you died today, will you have died well?</h3>
<p>This is something I have always written on at the end of my day, and so it <em>had</em> to be adopted into this format. I think the best gift a person can give to themselves is a good death, but that can only be done by being happy with yourself.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! I have had a wonderful time with this format vs. some of the others I have done in the past and I have felt it has helped be both prepare for my day, and end my day well. If you try it out, let me know how it goes!</p>
