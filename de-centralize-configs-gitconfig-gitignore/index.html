<p>Today I did some experimenting. You see my system is entirely customized to be super-efficient and automated.</p>
<p><a href="/images/greenshot-2020-09-18-184905.png"><img src="/images/greenshot-2020-09-18-184905.png" alt="Screenshot of my current .config"></a></p>
<p>As you can see I currently have these housed in a giant Git repository in my <code>~/.config/</code>. This has worked out just fine for a while, but I wanted to experiment with trying to de-centralize it with some kind of package management.</p>
<p>Today I focused on my <code>.gitconfig</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> files as an experiment with just my &ldquo;dot-files&rdquo;, and this is what I&rsquo;ve come up with:</p>
<p>So I wantedo to figure out what package manager is going to best serve me here. After looking at a lot of them, e.g. npm, bpkg, composer, and a slew of others, I settled on spamming Composer. I know my &ldquo;packages&rdquo; are not PHP, but Composer doesn&rsquo;t care about that, plus of all the package managers it&rsquo;s the easiest to install with git repo support (try doing that with npm or other package managers out there), it manages them well in a reliable location, and on top of that with <code>composer-installers</code> I think I can do some really cool magic later on&hellip;</p>
<p>So I settled on Composer, hate me.</p>
<p>So first I got my <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>.gitconfig</code> files into their own packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aubreypwd/.gitconfig">https://github.com/aubreypwd/.gitconfig</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aubreypwd/.gitignore">https://github.com/aubreypwd/.gitignore</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;that I could now easliy install to a reliable place, <code>~/.composer</code>. Both packages automatically symlink my <code>~/.gitconfig|ignore</code> file for me using the <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/sioweb/ccevent"><code>/sioweb/ccevent</code></a> package. Even if you supply, e.g. a <code>post-package-install</code> script for the package, because you install it as a dependancy those scripts to not fire. But this package, when installed along side it, will look for <code>package-scripts</code> and run those, so I was able to add that to both packages and when you install them that automatically runs and runs a <code>symlink.sh</code> script.</p>
<p>This symlinking solution on install is great because once I install one of these packages, it symlinks my dot-file in <code>$HOME</code> for me, vs me having to do it manually.</p>
<p>So now I can install dot-files individually and I can automate symlinking them!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious how the rest of this experiment is going to go&hellip;</p>
